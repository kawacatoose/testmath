Simple Calculator - BASH script exercise

Task

Write a script that will act as a simple calculator for add, subtract, multiply and divide.

    Each operation should have its own function.
    Any of the three methods for bash arithmetic, ($((..)), let, or expr) may be used.
    The user should give 3 arguments when executing the script:
    - The first should be one of the letters a, s, m, or d to specify which math operation.
    - The second and third arguments should be the numbers that are being operated on.
     The script should detect for bad or missing input values and display the results when done.
